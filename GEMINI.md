# GEMINI.md - Project Context

## 1. User Information
- **Operating System:** linux
- **Working Directory:** `/home/genr/Documents/code/python/python-algorithms`
- **Date:** Monday, August 25, 2025

## 2. Project Overview
The user's goal is to create a comprehensive, practical training plan for Python technical interviews, aiming for a "powerful level". The project is structured around **problem-solving techniques and design patterns**, providing a pattern-based approach to interview preparation. It includes three main modules: Fundamentals, Problem-Solving Techniques, and Design Patterns.

Each topic within these modules contains up to five components:
1.  **Theory:** Detailed explanations of concepts.
2.  **Challenges:** Practical coding exercises with tests.
3.  **Solutions:** Optimal solutions for the challenges.
4.  **Exams:** Short evaluations to reinforce understanding.
5.  **Cheatsheets:** Concise summaries for quick review.

Additionally, the project contains a dynamic `index.html` for easy navigation and a guide on Prompt Engineering.

## 3. File Structure
The project has been restructured to focus on techniques and patterns. The final structure is as follows:

```
/home/genr/Documents/code/python/python-algorithms/

    └── ... (and so on for all topics)
```

## 4. Key Logic & File Descriptions
- **`training/`**: Contains the Fundamentals and Problem-Solving Techniques modules.
- **`design_patterns/`**: Contains the Design Patterns module, with theory, challenges, solutions, exams, and cheatsheets for 24 patterns.
- **`index.html`**: A dynamic, single-page web interface to navigate all training materials, rendering Markdown and code with syntax highlighting.
- **`prompt_engineering/`**: A guide on effective prompting for LLMs in a software development context.

## 5. User Preferences & Goals
- The primary goal is to achieve a "powerful level" in Python for technical interviews by mastering problem-solving patterns and design principles.
- All created documents must be in English.
- The user prefers an iterative development process.

## 6. Recent Activity
- Added a comprehensive **Design Patterns** module covering 24 fundamental patterns.
- Generated all associated materials (theory, challenges, solutions, exams, cheatsheets) for the new module.
- Updated and fixed the `index.html` file to correctly display all three modules (Fundamentals, Techniques, and Design Patterns).
- Created a Git checkpoint for the new module.
- The last action was to update this `GEMINI.md` file.
