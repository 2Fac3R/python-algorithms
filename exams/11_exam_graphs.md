# Exam: Graphs

**Instructions:** Answer the following questions based on the theory document.

---

### Question 1 (Representation)

What is the most common way to represent a graph in a coding interview, and what is its main advantage for sparse graphs (graphs with relatively few edges)?

- **Method:** ?
- **Advantage:** ?

---

### Question 2 (Concept)

When traversing a graph, what is the primary purpose of using a `visited` set?

a) To store the final path.
b) To make the traversal faster.
c) To prevent getting stuck in infinite loops in graphs with cycles.
d) To count the number of nodes.

### Question 3 (Application)

If you need to find the shortest path (in terms of number of edges) between two nodes in an **unweighted** graph, which traversal algorithm should you always choose?

- **Answer:** ?

---

### Question 4 (Analysis)

Given the following adjacency list for an undirected graph:
`graph = {0: [1], 1: [0, 2], 2: [1], 3: [4], 4: [3]}`

Is there a path between node `0` and node `4`?

- **Answer (Yes/No):** ?
