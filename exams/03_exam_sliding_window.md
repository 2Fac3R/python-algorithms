# Exam: Sliding Window

**Instructions:** Answer the following questions based on the theory document.

---

### Question 1 (Concept)

What kind of problems are best suited for the Sliding Window technique?

a) Problems involving sorting a list.
b) Problems that require finding an optimal or specific **subsequence** (like a subarray or substring).
c) Problems that involve searching for a single element in a sorted array.
d) Problems about validating nested structures.

### Question 2 (Pattern Identification)

You are asked to find the "longest substring with at most `k` distinct characters". Since the length of the substring is not fixed, which Sliding Window pattern should you use?

- **Pattern:** ?

### Question 3 (Code Logic)

In a variable-size window, you have two pointers, `start` and `end`. Which pointer is responsible for **expanding** the window, and which is responsible for **shrinking** it when a condition is violated?

- **Expanding Pointer:** ?
- **Shrinking Pointer:** ?

### Question 4 (Use Case)

To find the "maximum sum of any contiguous subarray of size `k`", you use a fixed-size window. After calculating the sum of the first window, how do you efficiently calculate the sum of the next window in O(1) time?

- **Answer:** ?
