# Solutions: Exam - Dynamic Programming (Intro)

---

### Question 1 (Concept)

What are the two key properties that a problem must have for Dynamic Programming to be an effective technique?

1.  **Overlapping Subproblems**
2.  **Optimal Substructure**

---

### Question 2 (Approaches)

What is the main difference between the **Memoization** and **Tabulation** approaches to DP?

- **Correct Answer:** b) Memoization is top-down (recursive), Tabulation is bottom-up (iterative).

---

### Question 3 (Analysis)

The "Climbing Stairs" problem, where you can take 1 or 2 steps at a time, is a classic DP problem that is equivalent to what famous mathematical sequence?

- **Answer:** The Fibonacci sequence.

---

### Question 4 (Application)

In a **Tabulation (bottom-up)** solution for the Coin Change problem for an `amount` of 10, you would typically create a `dp` array. What would `dp[i]` represent in this array?

- **Answer:** `dp[i]` would represent the **minimum number of coins** required to make an amount of `i`.
