2.  ?

---

### Question 2 (Approaches)

What is the main difference between the **Memoization** and **Tabulation** approaches to DP?

a) Memoization is iterative, Tabulation is recursive.
b) Memoization is top-down (recursive), Tabulation is bottom-up (iterative).
c) Memoization is always faster than Tabulation.
d) Memoization uses O(1) space.

### Question 3 (Analysis)

The "Climbing Stairs" problem, where you can take 1 or 2 steps at a time, is a classic DP problem that is equivalent to what famous mathematical sequence?

- **Answer:** ?

### Question 4 (Application)

In a **Tabulation (bottom-up)** solution for the Coin Change problem for an `amount` of 10, you would typically create a `dp` array. What would `dp[i]` represent in this array?
