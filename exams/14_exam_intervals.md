# Exam: Interval Problems

**Instructions:** Answer the following questions based on the theory document.

---

### Question 1 (Concept)

What is the single most important first step for solving almost any interval-based problem?

- **Answer:** ?

---

### Question 2 (Analysis)

Assuming you have two intervals that are already sorted by their start times, `A = [start_A, end_A]` and `B = [start_B, end_B]`. What is the simple condition to check if they overlap?

- **Condition:** `start_B <= _______`

---

### Question 3 (Application)

If you determine that `A = [3, 9]` and `B = [5, 12]` overlap, what is the resulting merged interval?

- **Answer:** ?

---

### Question 4 (Algorithm Logic)

When iterating through a sorted list of intervals to merge them, you compare the `current_interval` with which other interval to check for an overlap?

a) The very first interval in the original list.
b) The interval that came just before the current one in the original list.
c) The last interval that was added to your `merged` results list.
d) All other intervals in the list.
