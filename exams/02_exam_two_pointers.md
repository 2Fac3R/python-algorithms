# Exam: Two Pointers

**Instructions:** Answer the following questions based on the theory document.

---

### Question 1 (Concept)

What is the primary goal of using the Two Pointers technique?

a) To make the code shorter.
b) To reduce the time or space complexity of a brute-force solution, often from O(nÂ²) to O(n).
c) To use less memory than a hash table.
d) To work with unsorted arrays.

### Question 2 (Pattern Identification)

You are given a **sorted** array and need to find a pair of elements that sum to a target value. Which Two Pointers pattern is most suitable for this, and where would you initialize the pointers?

- **Pattern:** ?
- **Initialization:** `left` pointer at ?, `right` pointer at ?

---

### Question 3 (Code Logic)

In the "Converging Pointers" pattern (e.g., `left` at start, `right` at end), if the current sum of `arr[left] + arr[right]` is **less than** the target, which pointer should you move to get closer to the target, and in which direction?

- **Pointer to move:** ?
- **Direction:** ?

### Question 4 (Use Case)

What is a classic problem that is perfectly solved using the **Fast & Slow** Two Pointers pattern to modify an array in-place?
