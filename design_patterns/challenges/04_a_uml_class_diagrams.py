Challenge: UML Class Diagram Interpretation

This challenge aims to test your understanding of UML Class Diagrams by asking you to interpret
and describe relationships between classes based on a textual representation of a diagram.

Your task is to:

1.  **Interpret Relationships:** For each pair of classes described below, identify the UML relationship
    and explain what it means conceptually.

    **Diagram Description:**
    -   `Vehicle <|-- Car`
    -   `Car o-- Engine`
    -   `Engine *-- Piston`
    -   `Driver -- Car`
    -   `Car --..> FuelPump`

    **Questions:**
    -   What is the relationship between `Vehicle` and `Car`?
    -   What is the relationship between `Car` and `Engine`?
    -   What is the relationship between `Engine` and `Piston`?
    -   What is the relationship between `Driver` and `Car`?
    -   What is the relationship between `Car` and `FuelPump`?

    (Provide your answers as comments in the Python code or in a separate text block.)

2.  **Conceptual Design (No Code Implementation Required):**
    -   Imagine you are designing a simple online store. You have `Customer`, `Order`, `Product`, and `ShoppingCart` classes.
    -   Describe the most appropriate UML relationship (Inheritance, Composition, Aggregation, Association, Dependency) between the following pairs and briefly explain why:
        -   `Customer` and `Order`
        -   `Order` and `Product`
        -   `ShoppingCart` and `Product`
        -   `ShoppingCart` and `Customer`

    (Provide your answers as comments in the Python code or in a separate text block.)
