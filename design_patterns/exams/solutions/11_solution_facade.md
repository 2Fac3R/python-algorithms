# Solutions: Exam - Facade Pattern

---

### Question 1 (Problem Solved)

What is the primary problem that the Facade pattern aims to solve?

-   **Answer:** The Facade pattern aims to solve the problem of simplifying the interface to a complex subsystem. When a system is composed of many classes with intricate relationships and dependencies, clients can find it difficult to interact with it directly. The Facade provides a single, unified, and simplified interface, hiding the complexity of the subsystem's internal workings.

### Question 2 (Key Components)

Identify and briefly describe the main components of the Facade pattern.

-   **Answer:**
    -   **Facade:** This is the class that provides the simplified, higher-level interface to the subsystem. It knows which subsystem classes are responsible for a client's request and delegates the requests to the appropriate subsystem objects (e.g., `HomeTheaterFacade`).
    -   **Subsystem Classes:** These are the individual classes within the complex subsystem that perform the actual work. They are unaware of the Facade and have no direct reference to it. They can communicate directly with each other (e.g., `Projector`, `Screen`, `Amplifier`, `DVDPlayer`).
    -   **Client:** This is the code that uses the Facade to interact with the subsystem. It does not directly interact with the complex subsystem classes, thus reducing its coupling to the subsystem.

### Question 3 (Benefits)

List two key benefits of using the Facade pattern in software design.

-   **Answer:**
    1.  **Simplifies Client Interface:** It provides a simpler, unified interface to a complex subsystem, making it easier for clients to use and understand the system.
    2.  **Decouples Client from Subsystem:** It reduces the dependencies between the client code and the complex internal workings of the subsystem, leading to more maintainable and flexible code.
    3.  **Improved Readability and Maintainability:** Client code becomes cleaner and easier to understand, as it interacts with a single facade object instead of many subsystem objects.
    4.  **Increased Testability:** The facade can be easily mocked or stubbed for testing purposes, as it provides a clear boundary for interaction with the subsystem.

### Question 4 (Scenario)

Imagine you are developing an e-commerce application. The order processing involves several complex steps: checking inventory, processing payment, updating order status, and sending a confirmation email. Each of these steps is handled by a separate, complex subsystem. How would you apply the Facade pattern to simplify the order placement process for the client?

-   **Answer:**
    1.  **Subsystem Classes:** You would have separate classes for each complex operation, such as `InventoryService`, `PaymentProcessor`, `OrderStatusUpdater`, and `EmailService`. Each of these would have its own methods for performing its specific task.
    2.  **Facade Class:** You would create an `OrderPlacementFacade` class. This class would take instances of `InventoryService`, `PaymentProcessor`, `OrderStatusUpdater`, and `EmailService` in its constructor.
    3.  **Simplified Method:** The `OrderPlacementFacade` would expose a single, simplified method, for example, `place_order(product_id, quantity, payment_details, user_email)`. Inside this method, the facade would orchestrate the calls to the various subsystem classes in the correct order:
        -   Call `InventoryService.check_stock(product_id, quantity)`.
        -   Call `PaymentProcessor.process_payment(payment_details)`.
        -   Call `OrderStatusUpdater.update_status(order_id, "processing")`.
        -   Call `EmailService.send_confirmation_email(user_email, order_details)`.
    4.  **Client Interaction:** The client code (e.g., a web controller or a user interface component) would then only need to interact with the `OrderPlacementFacade` by calling `order_facade.place_order(...)`, without needing to know the intricate details of how inventory is checked, payments are processed, or emails are sent.
