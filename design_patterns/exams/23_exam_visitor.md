---

### Question 2 (Key Components)

Identify and briefly describe the main components of the Visitor pattern.

- **Answer:** ?

---

### Question 3 (Adding New Operations)

How does the Visitor pattern allow you to add new operations to an object structure without modifying the classes of the elements?

- **Answer:** ?

---

### Question 4 (Scenario)

Imagine you are building a compiler for a programming language. The Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) consists of various node types (e.g., `AssignmentNode`, `VariableNode`, `FunctionCallNode`, `IfStatementNode`). You need to perform several operations on this AST, such as:

-   **Code Generation:** Convert the AST into executable machine code or bytecode.
-   **Type Checking:** Verify that all types in the AST are consistent and valid.
-   **Optimization:** Apply various optimizations to the AST.

How would you apply the Visitor pattern to design these operations, ensuring that you can add new operations without modifying the AST node classes?

- **Answer:** ?
