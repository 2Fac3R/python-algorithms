# Exam: Abstract Classes and Interfaces in Python

**Instructions:** Answer the following questions based on the theory document.

---

### Question 1 (Abstract Class Purpose)

What is the primary purpose of an abstract class in Python, and what is a key characteristic that distinguishes it from a regular class?

-   **Answer:** ?

---

### Question 2 (Defining Abstract Methods)

How do you define an abstract method in Python, and what happens if a concrete subclass fails to implement all abstract methods from its abstract base class?

-   **Answer:** ?

---

### Question 3 (Interfaces in Python)

### Question 4 (Scenario: Payment Gateway)

Imagine you are building a payment processing system. You need to integrate with various payment gateways (e.g., PayPal, Stripe, Square), each with its own way of processing payments. You want to ensure that any new payment gateway added to the system adheres to a common contract, and that your core payment logic can work with any gateway without knowing its specific implementation details.

How would you use abstract classes or ABCs in Python to design a flexible and extensible payment gateway integration, demonstrating the definition of a common interface and a concrete implementation?

-   **Answer:** ?
