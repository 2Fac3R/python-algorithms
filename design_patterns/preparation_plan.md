# Initial Preparation Plan for Design Patterns Study

To get the most out of this design patterns study plan, it's crucial to have a solid foundation in certain programming and software design concepts. This document outlines the recommended prerequisites.

## 1. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Design patterns are solutions to common problems in object-oriented software design. Therefore, a deep understanding of OOP principles is **absolutely essential**.

**Key concepts to master:**

-   Classes and Objects
-   Encapsulation
-   Inheritance
-   Polymorphism
-   Abstraction
-   Composition vs. Inheritance

**Detailed Resource:** Refer to `design_patterns/theory/00_object_oriented_programming.md` for a comprehensive explanation.

## 2. Software Design Principles (SOLID)

Design patterns are often the practical implementation of one or more SOLID principles. Understanding these principles will help you grasp the *why* behind many patterns.

**Principles to master:**

-   **S** - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
-   **O** - Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
-   **L** - Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
-   **I** - Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
-   **D** - Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

**Detailed Resource:** Refer to `design_patterns/theory/01_solid_principles.md` for a comprehensive explanation.

## 3. Abstract Classes and Interfaces in Python

Many design patterns rely on the definition of interfaces and abstract classes to achieve flexibility and decoupling. In Python, this is primarily achieved through the `abc` (Abstract Base Classes) module.

**Key concepts to master:**

-   `abc.ABC` and `@abstractmethod`: How to define abstract classes and methods.
-   Interfaces (conceptual): How Python handles interfaces through ABCs or duck typing.

**Detailed Resource:** Refer to `design_patterns/theory/02_abstract_classes_interfaces_python.md` for a comprehensive explanation.

## 4. Composition and Aggregation

The "has-a" relationship is fundamental in structural patterns and in OOP in general. Understanding the difference between strong composition and weak aggregation is important.

**Key concepts to master:**

-   Composition: When one object is part of another and cannot exist without it (strong relationship).
-   Aggregation: When one object uses another, but the latter can exist independently (weak relationship).

**Detailed Resource:** Refer to `design_patterns/theory/03_composition_vs_inheritance.md` for a comprehensive explanation.

## 5. UML Class Diagrams

UML Class Diagrams are a standard visual tool for representing the structure of object-oriented systems. Familiarity with basic UML class diagrams will help you interpret the diagrams provided in the theory documents.

**Key concepts to master:**

-   Classes, interfaces, abstract classes.
-   Relationships: Inheritance (generalization), implementation, association, aggregation, composition, dependency.
-   Visibility: Public (+), Protected (#), Private (-).

**Detailed Resource:** Refer to `design_patterns/theory/04_uml_class_diagrams.md` for a comprehensive explanation.

## Conclusion

Mastering these concepts will provide you with the necessary foundation to approach design patterns with confidence. A good understanding of OOP, SOLID principles, abstractions in Python, and reading UML will allow you not only to memorize patterns, but to understand their purpose, advantages and disadvantages, and how to implement them effectively in your own Python projects.
