# Python Interview Training Plan

This repository contains a comprehensive, practical training plan for achieving a powerful level in Python for technical interviews. The plan is structured around mastering problem-solving techniques and fundamental software design principles.

## How to Use

The best way to navigate this project is by opening the `index.html` file in your web browser. It provides an interactive, single-page interface to all the training materials.

To run it locally, you can use Python's built-in web server:
```bash
python3 -m http.server
```
Then, open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

## Content Overview

The training plan is divided into three main sections:

### I. Fundamentals
This section covers the essential prerequisite knowledge for the entire course, including:
- **Big O Notation:** For analyzing algorithm complexity.
- **Python Fundamentals:** A review of core Python concepts relevant to interviews.

### II. Problem-Solving Techniques
This is the core of the plan, focusing on a pattern-based approach to problem-solving. It covers 17 essential techniques, from foundational patterns to advanced algorithms, each with:
- Detailed theory explanations.
- Practical coding challenges with tests.
- Optimal solutions.
- Short exams to reinforce understanding.
- Concise cheatsheets for quick review.

### III. Design Patterns
This section provides a deep dive into 24 fundamental software design patterns, categorized into Creational, Structural, and Behavioral groups. Similar to the techniques section, each pattern includes:
- In-depth theory.
- A practical coding challenge and solution.
- An exam with solutions.
- A quick-reference cheatsheet.

This structured approach ensures a solid foundation and the ability to recognize and apply common patterns to solve a wide range of interview problems.
